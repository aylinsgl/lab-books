# 🧠 Lab Books

Welcome to my Lab Books, a collection of research projects I worked on during my PhD at the [Scene Grammar Lab](https://www.scenegrammarlab.com/) (2021–2025). This site serves as a living documentation of my work, including project descriptions, code, tutorials, and materials.

🚧 Work in Progress: I'm continuously updating tutorials, refining explanations, and adding new content, so be sure to check back regularly!

## 🔍 What You’ll Find Here

Each project has its own dedicated page, providing:

- 📖 A detailed project description
